        <b> Strategic Relationships :  </b><br> <br>
        At Blackstone Capital, we believe that transformative investing is powered by insight, scale, and world-class
        relationships. Over the years, we have cultivated a network of institutional collaborators whose global reach
        and
        financial expertise have complemented our investment philosophy and enhanced our ability to deliver enduring
        value.

        We are proud to have engaged with leading global institutions across advisory, structuring, and co-investment
        initiatives, including:
        BlackRock — for macroeconomic research, ESG-aligned asset strategies, and co-insight on portfolio risk modeling.

        Vanguard — for asset allocation benchmarking and institutional capital market perspectives.

        Goldman Sachs — as a strategic advisor across complex transactions, capital structuring, and global financing
        solutions.

        J.P. Morgan — for cross-border M&A financing, private placements, and strategic market intelligence.

        Morgan Stanley — for advisory on real assets, healthcare buyouts, and infrastructure transactions.

        Lazard — for select deal structuring and sector-specific valuation insights in energy and fintech.

        UBS — for global capital markets access and investor syndication.

        These relationships reflect our commitment to institutional rigor, strategic alignment, and global standards in
        private capital investment. <br>
