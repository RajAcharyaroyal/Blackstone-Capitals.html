      Founded in 2005, Blackstone Capital emerged with a singular vision: to shape the future of global investing through
    intelligent capital deployment, deep operational expertise, and a long-term view on value creation. From our early
    beginnings in New York to our presence today across major financial centers, we have grown into a globally
    recognized private equity and investment management firm.

    Our early years were defined by disciplined growth, strategic alignment with premier global institutions, and a
    sharp focus on sectors undergoing structural transformation. As our investment philosophy matured, so too did our
    capacity to influence outcomes — not just through capital, but through leadership, innovation, and global reach.

    By the mid-2010s, Blackstone Capital had established itself as a trusted steward of institutional capital, scaling a
    diversified portfolio spanning infrastructure, real assets, healthcare innovation, digital platforms, and
    sustainable industries. We cultivated long-term partnerships with sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and family
    offices, deploying capital with precision and purpose across both developed and emerging markets.

    The 2020s marked a period of expanded influence, with the firm deepening its footprint across Asia, Africa, and
    Europe, while leading cross-border investments that shaped industries and accelerated transformation. With a
    strategic blend of private equity, growth capital, and infrastructure investments, we focused on businesses poised
    to define the next generation of value — from clean energy and advanced logistics to frontier technologies and
    next-gen financial services.

    In 2032, with a new chapter of leadership and vision, Blackstone Capital reinforced its commitment to global impact
    and institutional excellence. Today, with over $60 billion in assets under management and a portfolio that spans
    multiple asset classes and continents, we continue to pursue opportunities where capital, experience, and insight
    converge to unlock extraordinary potential.
